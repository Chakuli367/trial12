GoalGrid – Product Development Overview
1. Core Product Vision

GoalGrid is an interactive social skills improvement platform that turns personal development into a game-like journey.
It helps users who feel isolated, lack confidence, or struggle with making friends to:

Take small, daily, real-life actions (e.g., smiling more, starting a conversation, giving compliments).

Track and visualize progress using engaging, game-inspired dashboards.

Receive AI-guided coaching (step-by-step guidance, role-play, and feedback).

Stay motivated through gamified progression, streaks, achievements, and community.

Think of it as Duolingo + SIMS for social skills.

2. Main Features
A. Onboarding + Signup

Clean signup/login page (email, Google, or GitHub auth).

Onboarding form asks: “What do you want to achieve?” (simple, one goal).

Store user goals in backend DB.

B. AI Guidance (Day-to-Day Experience)

User gets daily missions powered by AI:

Example: Day 1 → Smile at 3 people and note their reaction.

Each day, the AI:

Explains why this matters.

Guides user through how to do it in real life.

Provides live action support (role-play chatbot for planning, e.g., “How do I compliment someone without sounding awkward?”).

Asks for reflection after completion.

C. Gamification Layer

Interactive Map Experience (H5P plugin in WordPress for now, later native):

Each lesson is a map node users unlock.

Nodes represent skills learned (e.g., “Genuine Interest”, “Complimenting”, “Conversations”).

Progress Tracking:

Donut charts (amCharts).

Streak counters, badges, and milestones.

Saved locally (localStorage) and per-user (WordPress + Firebase backend).

D. Dashboard / Daily Overlay

Full-page overlay (#goalPlannerOverlay) that shows:

AI-generated plan (from LLaMA 3 backend).

Animated donut chart of daily/weekly progress.

Floating background animations (books, progress orbs).

Badges and Achievements.

Journaling area for reflection.

E. AI Lesson Engine

Based on Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People.

Lessons structured into multi-page HTML flows:

Page 1: Concept explanation.

Page 2: Why it matters.

Page 3: Real-life application (with Buffett quotes, consequences, examples).

Page 4: Interactive choice-based practice.

Page 5: Reflection + AI plan for next action.

F. Community + Accountability (Later Phase)

Not just solo — users can:

Join 5-day challenges.

Share progress with others.

Receive supportive feedback.

3. Technical Stack

Frontend (User Side)

WordPress (Business Plan) + Custom HTML blocks for now.

Interactive content via H5P plugin + CBX Take a Tour plugin.

React components (for more advanced dashboards, Replit experiments).

LocalStorage to cache progress.

Backend

LLaMA 3 AI backend for generating plans, lessons, and chatbot responses.

Firebase for auth + user data storage.

Node.js/Express microservices (e.g., /finalize-day-chat endpoint).

Data Flow

User enters goal → stored in DB.

AI generates daily plan (saved under goalplanner_saved_plan).

Plan rendered in overlay/dashboard.

Progress updates (e.g., chart increments, badges).

Reflections saved for continuity.
